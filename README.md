# Compiler
My compiler project in Nanjing University, which contains four sub-projects:  

I use Python to do this, with the help of library PLY  

> Lab 1: Lexical Analysis & Syntax Analysis  
> Lab 2: Semantic Analysis  
> Lab 3: Generating Intermediate Code  
> Lab 4: Generating Target Code  

Finally, the program in Lab 4 can translate a C-- program into assembly program which can run on SPIM simulator.
